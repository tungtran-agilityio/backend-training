## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ pnpm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.

## Environment Variables

You must set the following environment variable in your .env file:

```
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
```

# Social Media App

A NestJS-based social media application with authentication, posts, comments, and user management.

## Features

- User registration and authentication (JWT)
- Post creation and management
- Comment system
- API versioning (v1)
- Security middleware with Helmet
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Rate limiting and throttling protection
- Comprehensive API documentation with Swagger

## Security

This application implements security best practices using [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/):

### Security Headers Enabled

Helmet automatically sets several security-related HTTP headers:

- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks  
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables XSS filtering
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Prevents code injection (disabled in development for Swagger compatibility)

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

CORS is configured to allow frontend applications to communicate with the API:

#### Development Mode
- **Origin**: All origins allowed (`*`)
- **Credentials**: Enabled for cookie-based authentication
- **Methods**: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS`
- **Headers**: `Content-Type`, `Authorization`

#### Production Mode
- **Origin**: Configured via `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable
- **Multiple Origins**: Comma-separated URLs (e.g., `https://app.example.com,https://admin.example.com`)
- **Fallback**: No origins allowed if `FRONTEND_URL` is not set

#### Environment Configuration

```bash
# Production CORS configuration
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourfrontend.com,https://youradmin.com

# Development - no configuration needed (allows all origins)
```

### Rate Limiting

The API implements multiple layers of rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage:

#### Global Rate Limits

All endpoints are protected with multiple rate limiting tiers:

- **Short Term**: 3 requests per second
- **Medium Term**: 20 requests per 10 seconds  
- **Long Term**: 100 requests per minute

#### Endpoint-Specific Limits

Sensitive endpoints have additional restrictions:

| Endpoint                  | Limit      | Duration | Purpose                     |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/login` | 3 requests | 1 minute | Prevent brute force attacks |
| `POST /api/v1/users`      | 2 requests | 1 minute | Prevent spam registrations  |

#### Rate Limit Headers

When rate limits are exceeded, the API returns:

- **Status Code**: `429 Too Many Requests`
- **Headers**: 
  - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Request limit
  - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests
  - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when limit resets

#### Testing Rate Limits

You can test rate limiting by making rapid requests:

```bash
# Test global rate limit (should get 429 after 3 requests)
for i in {1..5}; do curl -w "\n%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health; done

# Test login rate limit
for i in {1..5}; do 
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"test"}' \
    -w "\n%{http_code}\n"
done
```

### Testing Security Headers

You can verify the security headers are working by making a request to any endpoint:

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health
```

You should see headers like:
```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-XSS-Protection: 0
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 99
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1674567890
```

## API Documentation

- **API Version**: v1
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`
